	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Aneurysm hemodynamics has been associated with wall histology and inflammation. We investigated associations between local hemodynamics and focal wall changes visible intraoperatively.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computational fluid dynamics models were constructed from 3D images of 65 aneurysms treated surgically. Aneurysm regions with different visual appearances were identified in intraoperative videos: 1) {\textquotedblleft}atherosclerotic{\textquotedblright} (yellow), 2) {\textquotedblleft}hyperplastic{\textquotedblright} (white), 3) {\textquotedblleft}thin{\textquotedblright} (red), 4) rupture site, and 5) {\textquotedblleft}normal{\textquotedblright} (similar to parent artery), They were marked on 3D reconstructions. Regional hemodynamics was characterized by the following: wall shear stress, oscillatory shear index, relative residence time, wall shear stress gradient and divergence, gradient oscillatory number, and dynamic pressure; these were compared using the Mann-Whitney test.RESULTS: Hyperplastic regions had lower average wall shear stress (P = .005) and pressure (P = .009) than normal regions. Flow conditions in atherosclerotic and hyperplastic regions were similar but had higher average relative residence time (P = .03) and oscillatory shear index (P = .04) than thin regions. Hyperplastic regions also had a higher average gradient oscillatory number (P = .002) than thin regions. Thin regions had lower average relative residence time (P \&lt; .001), oscillatory shear index (P = .006), and gradient oscillatory number (P \&lt; .001) than normal regions, and higher average wall shear stress (P = .006) and pressure (P = .009) than hyperplastic regions. Thin regions tended to be aligned with the flow stream, while atherosclerotic and hyperplastic regions tended to be aligned with recirculation zones.CONCLUSIONS: Local hemodynamics is associated with visible focal wall changes. Slow swirling flow with low and oscillatory wall shear stress was associated with atherosclerotic and hyperplastic changes. High flow conditions prevalent in regions near the flow impingement site characterized by higher and less oscillatory wall shear stress were associated with local {\textquotedblleft}thinning{\textquotedblright} of the wall.avgaverageGONgradient oscillatory numberIAintracranial aneurysmmaxmaximumminminimumOSIoscillatory shear indexPREdynamic pressureRRTrelative residence timeUIAunruptured intracranial aneurysmWSSwall shear stress},

    abstract = {Background and Purpose The authors evaluated the impact of morphologic and hemodynamic factors on multiple intracranial aneurysms and aimed to identify which parameters can be reliable indexes as one aneurysm ruptured, and the others did not.   Methods Between June 2011 and May 2014, 69 patients harboring multiple intracranial aneurysms (69 ruptured and 86 unruptured) were analyzed from 3D-digital subtraction angiography (DSA) images and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Morphologic and hemodynamic parameters were evaluated for significance with respect to rupture. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis identified area under the curve (AUC) and optimal thresholds separating ruptured from unruptured intracranial aneurysms for each parameter. Significant parameters were examined by binary logistic regression analysis to identify independent discriminators.   Results Nine morphologic (size, neck width, surface area, volume, diameter of parent arteries, aspect ratio, size ratio, lateral/bifurcation type and regular/irregular type) and 6 hemodynamic (WSSmean, WSSmin, OSI, LSA, flow stability and flow complexity) parameters achieved statistical significance (p<0.05). Six morphologic (size, surface area, volume, aspect ratio, size ratio and regular/irregular type) and five hemodynamic (WSSmean, WSSmin, LSA, flow stability and flow complexity) parameters had high AUC values (AUC>0.7). By binary logistic regression analysis, large aspect ratio and low WSSmean were the independently significant rupture factors (AUC, 0.924; 95% CI, 0.883–0.965).   Conclusions Large aspect ratio and low WSSmean were independently associated with the rupture status of multiple intracranial aneurysms.},

	abstract = {Summary: Increasing detection of unruptured intracranial aneurysms, catastrophic outcomes from subarachnoid hemorrhage, and risks and cost of treatment necessitate defining objective predictive parameters of aneurysm rupture risk. Image-based computational fluid dynamics models have suggested associations between hemodynamics and intracranial aneurysm rupture, albeit with conflicting findings regarding wall shear stress. We propose that the {\textquotedblleft}high-versus-low wall shear stress{\textquotedblright} controversy is a manifestation of the complexity of aneurysm pathophysiology, and both high and low wall shear stress can drive intracranial aneurysm growth and rupture. Low wall shear stress and high oscillatory shear index trigger an inflammatory-cell-mediated pathway, which could be associated with the growth and rupture of large, atherosclerotic aneurysm phenotypes, while high wall shear stress combined with a positive wall shear stress gradient trigger a mural-cell-mediated pathway, which could be associated with the growth and rupture of small or secondary bleb aneurysm phenotypes. This hypothesis correlates disparate intracranial aneurysm pathophysiology with the results of computational fluid dynamics in search of more reliable risk predictors.

abstract="The present study was performed to investigate deposition probability of blood particles on the vessel walls. To track dynamics of movement and adhesion of blood particles in the near wall region, two models such as the particle rolling model (PR-model) and the near wall force model (NWF-model) were employed in the present study. Simulations of the present models for the pre-activated platelets in the stagnated point flow chamber and for the pre-activated monocytes in the stenotic perfusion tube resulted in significant correlations with the experimental data. The proposed near wall deposition probability (NWDP) index exhibited good fits with the experimental data of the stagnation point flow chamber for the platelet. As for the monocyte, the NWDP index exhibited the best fit with the experimental data of the stenotic tube. The new hemodynamic index, NWDP, is different from the wall shear stress (WSS)-based hemodynamic parameters, such as MWSS (Mean Wall Shear Stress), AWSS (Amplitude of Wall Shear Stress), and OSI (Oscillatory Shear Index) in that it locates regions of both the high and low WSS. The proposed NWDP index needs to be tested and compared in real geometries for its effectiveness in locating regions of lesion-prone sites.",

In addition to borrowing many techniques from the statistics and engineering literatures, chemometrics itself has given rise to several new data-analytical methods. This article examines two methods commonly used in chemometrics for predictive modeling-partial least squares and principal components regression-from a statistical perspective. The goal is to try to understand their apparent successes and in what situations they can be expected to work well and to compare them with other statistical methods intended for those situations. These methods include ordinary least squares, variable subset selection, and ridge regression.},

Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine parameters that independently characterized the rupture status of MCA aneurysms. Results{\textemdash}Univariate analyses showed that the aspect ratio, wall shear stress (WSS), normalized WSS, oscillatory shear index, WSS gradient, and aneurysm-formation index were significant parameters. The size of the aneurysmal dome and the gradient oscillatory number were not significantly different between the 2 groups. With multivariate analyses, only lower WSS was significantly associated with the rupture status of MCA aneurysms.

	abstract = {Background and Purpose{\textemdash}The purpose of this study was to identify significant morphological and hemodynamic parameters that discriminate intracranial aneurysm rupture status using 3-dimensional angiography and computational fluid dynamics. Methods{\textemdash}One hundred nineteen intracranial aneurysms (38 ruptured, 81 unruptured) were analyzed from 3-dimensional angiographic images and computational fluid dynamics. Six morphological and 7 hemodynamic parameters were evaluated for significance with respect to rupture. Receiver operating characteristic analysis identified area under the curve (AUC) and optimal thresholds separating ruptured from unruptured aneurysms for each parameter. Significant parameters were examined by multivariate logistic regression analysis in 3 predictive models{\textemdash}morphology only, hemodynamics only, and combined{\textemdash}to identify independent discriminants, and the AUC receiver operating characteristic of the predicted probability of rupture status was compared among these models. Results{\textemdash}Morphological parameters (size ratio, undulation index, ellipticity index, and nonsphericity index) and hemodynamic parameters (average wall shear stress [WSS], maximum intra-aneurysmal WSS, low WSS area, average oscillatory shear index, number of vortices, and relative resident time) achieved statistical significance (P\&lt;0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated size ratio to be the only independently significant factor in the morphology model (AUC, 0.83; 95\% CI, 0.75 to 0.91), whereas WSS and oscillatory shear index were the only independently significant variables in the hemodynamics model (AUC, 0.85; 95\% CI, 0.78 to 0.93). The combined model retained all 3 variables, size ratio, WSS, and oscillatory shear index (AUC, 0.89; 95\% CI, 0.82 to 0.96). Conclusion{\textemdash}All 3 models{\textemdash}morphological (based on size ratio), hemodynamic (based on WSS and oscillatory shear index), and combined{\textemdash}discriminate intracranial aneurysm rupture status with high AUC values. Hemodynamics is as important as morphology in discriminating aneurysm rupture status.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose{\textemdash}Follow-up imaging is often performed in intracranial aneurysms that are not treated. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on patient- and aneurysm-specific risk factors for aneurysm growth.Methods{\textemdash}We searched EMBASE and MEDLINE for cohort studies describing risk factors for aneurysm growth. Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and rated quality with the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. With univariable Poisson regression analysis, we calculated risk ratios (RRs) with corresponding 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI) of risk factors for aneurysm growth. Heterogeneity was assessed with I2.Results{\textemdash}Eighteen studies on 15 patient-populations described 3990 patients with 4972 unruptured aneurysms. A total of 437 aneurysms (9\%) enlarged during 13 987 aneurysm-years of follow-up. Compared with aneurysms <=4 mm, RRs were 2.56 (95\% CI, 1.93{\textendash}3.39; I2=98\%) for >=5 mm, 2.80 (95\% CI, 2.01{\textendash}3.90; I2=96\%) for >=7 mm, and 5.38 (95\% CI, 3.76{\textendash}7.70; I2=97\%) for >=10 mm. Compared with aneurysms on the middle cerebral artery, the RR for basilar artery was 1.94 (95\% CI, 1.32{\textendash}2.83; I2=57\%). RRs were 2.03 (95\% CI, 1.52{\textendash}2.71; I2=59\%) for smoking at baseline, 2.04 (95\% CI, 1.56{\textendash}2.66; I2=90\%) for multiple unruptured aneurysms, 1.26 (95\% CI, 0.97{\textendash}1.62; I2=59\%) for women, 1.24 (95\% CI, 0.98{\textendash}1.58; I2=40\%) for hypertension, and 2.32 (95\% CI, 1.46{\textendash}3.68; I2=91\%) for irregular aneurysm shape. Compared with other regions, RR was 0.75 (95\% CI, 0.58{\textendash}0.96) for Japan and 0.64 (95\% CI, 0.45{\textendash}0.90) for Finland.Conclusions{\textemdash}Most risk factors for aneurysm growth are consistent with risk factors for rupture. In contrast with rupture, the risk of growth was smaller in Japanese and Finnish cohorts compared with other regions. Pooling of individual patient data from low- and high-risk geographical regions is needed to assess independent predictors of aneurysm growth.},

Methods{\textemdash}One hundred and eighteen patients (61 women) with UIAs were diagnosed between 1956 and 1978 and followed up until death or subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The median age at the diagnosis was 43.5 years (range, 22.6{\textendash}60.7 years). The median size of the UIA at the diagnosis was 4 mm (range, 2{\textendash}25 mm). Analyzed risk factors for a rupture included sex, age, cigarette smoking, systolic blood pressure values, diagnosed hypertension, UIA size, and number of UIAs. Results{\textemdash}Thirty four (29\%) out of 118 people had SAH during the lifelong follow-up. The median age at SAH was 51.3 years (range, 30.1{\textendash}71.8 years). The annual rupture rate per patient was 1.6\%. Female sex, current smoking, and aneurysm size of >=7 mm in diameter were risk factors for a lifetime SAH. Depending on the risk factor burden, the lifetime risk of an aneurysmal SAH varied from 0\% to 100\%, and the annual rupture rate from 0\% to 6.5\%. Of the 96 patients with small (\&lt;7 mm) UIAs, 24 (25\%) had an aneurysmal SAH during the follow-up. Conclusions{\textemdash}Almost 30\% of all UIAs in people of working age ruptured during a lifelong follow-up. The risk varied substantially on the basis of risk factor burden. Because even small UIAs ruptured, treatment decisions of UIAs should perhaps be based on the risk factor status.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose{\textemdash}The presence of multiple intracranial aneurysms may be a sign of significant risk factors for aneurysm formation that differ from those factors that increase risk for aneurysm rupture. Only 2 studies concern independent risk factors for multiple aneurysms, and the results are in part controversial. This study was designed to identify independent risk factors for multiple intracranial aneurysms in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Methods{\textemdash}Of 266 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (139 men and 127 women, aged 15 to 60 years), 80 (30\%) had multiple intracranial aneurysms. The prevalence of several health-related habits, previous diseases, and medications of these patients were compared by multiple logistic regression between those with single and those with multiple aneurysms. Results{\textemdash}On the basis of multivariate statistics, only regular cigarette smoking at any time was a significant risk factor for the presence of multiple aneurysms. The odds ratio (OR) of smoking for multiple aneurysms was 2.10 (95\% CI, 1.06 to 4.13) after adjustment for age and sex. After additional adjustment for hypertension, the risk was 2.06 (95\% CI, 1.04 to 4.07). Of other variables, only age (OR, 1.02 per year; 95\% CI, 1.00 to 1.05; P=0.09) and female sex (OR, 1.60; 95\% CI, 0.90 to 2.85; P=0.11) showed a tendency to increase the risk for multiple aneurysms after adjustment for smoking. On the other hand, patients with hypertension had significantly (P=0.029) more aneurysms (1.61{\textpm}1.04) than did those without (1.37{\textpm}0.68), although they did not more frequently have multiple aneurysms. Conclusions{\textemdash}Cigarette smoking and possibly also age and female sex seem to be risk factors for multiple intracranial aneurysms in patients of working age who have suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Patients with hypertension seem to have more aneurysms than those without.},

We performed an updated systematic review and meta-analysis on the surgical treatment of UIAs, in an attempt to determine the aneurysm occlusion rates and safety of surgery in the modern era. Methods A detailed protocol was developed prior to conducting the review according to the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. Electronic databases spanning January 1990{\textendash}April 2011 were searched, complemented by hand searching. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2, and publication bias with funnel plots. Surgical mortality and morbidity were analysed with weighted random effect models. Results 60 studies with 9845 patients harbouring 10 845 aneurysms were included. Mortality occurred in 157 patients (1.7\%; 99\% CI 0.9\% to 3.0\%; I2=82\%). Unfavourable outcomes, including death, occurred in 692 patients (6.7\%; 99\% CI 4.9\% to 9.0\%; I2=85\%). Morbidity rates were significantly greater in higher quality studies, and with large or posterior circulation aneurysms. Reported morbidity rates decreased over time. Studies were generally of poor quality; funnel plots showed heterogeneous results and publication bias, and data on aneurysm occlusion rates were scant. Conclusions In studies published between 1990 and 2011, clipping of UIAs was associated with 1.7\% mortality and 6.7\% overall morbidity. The reputed durability of clipping has not been rigorously documented. Due to the quality of the included studies, the available literature cannot properly guide clinical decisions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Saccular intracranial aneurysm is a common disease that may cause devastating intracranial hemorrhage. Hemodynamics, wall remodeling, and wall inflammation have been associated with saccular intracranial aneurysm rupture. We investigated how saccular intracranial aneurysm hemodynamics is associated with wall remodeling and inflammation of the saccular intracranial aneurysm wall.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tissue samples resected during a saccular intracranial aneurysm operation (11 unruptured, 9 ruptured) were studied with histology and immunohistochemistry. Patient-specific computational models of hemodynamics were created from preoperative CT angiographies.RESULTS: More stable and less complex flows were associated with thick, hyperplastic saccular intracranial aneurysm walls, while slower flows with more diffuse inflow were associated with degenerated and decellularized saccular intracranial aneurysm walls. Wall degeneration (P = .041) and rupture were associated with increased inflammation (CD45+, P = .031). High wall shear stress (P = .018), higher vorticity (P = .046), higher viscous dissipation (P = .046), and high shear rate (P = .046) were associated with increased inflammation. Inflammation was also associated with lack of an intact endothelium (P = .034) and the presence of organized luminal thrombosis (P = .018), though overall organized thrombosis was associated with low minimum wall shear stress (P = .034) and not with the flow conditions associated with inflammation.CONCLUSIONS: Flow conditions in the saccular intracranial aneurysm are associated with wall remodeling. Inflammation, which is associated with degenerative wall remodeling and rupture, is related to high flow activity, including elevated wall shear stress. Endothelial injury may be a mechanism by which flow induces inflammation in the saccular intracranial aneurysm wall. Hemodynamic simulations might prove useful in identifying saccular intracranial aneurysms at risk of developing inflammation, a potential biomarker for rupture.maxmaximumOSIoscillatory shear indexsIAsaccular intracranial aneurysmVOvorticityWSSwall shear stress},

abstract="Helical flow in the human aorta is possibly a typical example of `form follows function' in the vascular system. The helical blood flow may provide guaranties for the inner surface of the ascending aortic wall to get smooth and even washing by the blood so that atherosclerotic plaques can hardly form in the area of the ascending aorta. It has been documented that the phenomenon of helical flow of blood is not just localized in the ascending aorta, it also exists in several large arteries and veins as well. Preliminary studies demonstrated the widely existing helical flow might play positive physiological roles in facilitating blood flow transport, suppressing disturbed blood flow, preventing the accumulation of atherogenic low density lipoproteins on the luminal surfaces of arteries, enhancing oxygen transport from the blood to the arterial wall and reducing the adhesion of blood cells on the arterial surface. These roles of helical blood flow may lessen the burden of arteries and protect the arteries from the pathology of atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and intimal hyperplasia. The great development of time-resolved three-dimensional phase contrast MRI (flow-sensitive 4D-MRI) and the advent of dimensionless indices such as helical flow index proposed to characterize helical flow make clinic quantification of the helical flow in the human large arteries possible. Moreover, researchers probed into the possibility to apply the mechanism of helical flow to the design of vascular interventions to reduce thrombus formation and intimal hyperplasia caused by abnormal flow conditions.",

However, it also contributes to pathology, including the initiation and perpetuation of inflammation. Understanding the function of endothelial cells (ECs) in inflammatory diseases and molecular mechanisms involved may lead to novel approaches to dampen inflammation and restore homeostasis. In this article, we discuss the various functions of ECs in inflammation with a focus on pathological angiogenesis, attraction of immune cells, antigen presentation, immunoregulatory properties and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT). We also review the current literature on approaches to target these processes in ECs to modulate immune responses and advance anti-inflammatory therapies.}

abstract={Saccular intracranial aneurysms (sIA) are pouch-like pathological dilatations of intracranial arteries that develop when the cerebral artery wall becomes too weak to resist hemodynamic pressure and distends. Some sIAs remain stable over time, but in others mural cells die, the matrix degenerates, and eventually the wall ruptures, causing life-threatening hemorrhage. The wall of unruptured sIAs is characterized by myointimal hyperplasia and organizing thrombus, whereas that of ruptured sIAs is characterized by a decellularized, degenerated matrix and a poorly organized luminal thrombus. Cell-mediated and humoral inflammatory reaction is seen in both, but inflammation is clearly associated with degenerated and ruptured walls. Inflammation, however, seems to be a reaction to the ongoing degenerative processes, rather than the cause. Current data suggest that the loss of mural cells and wall degeneration are related to impaired endothelial function and high oxidative stress, caused in part by luminal thrombosis. The aberrant flow conditions caused by sIA geometry are the likely cause of the endothelial dysfunction, which results in accumulation of cytotoxic and pro-inflammatory substances into the sIA wall, as well as thrombus formation. This may start the processes that eventually can lead to the decellularized and degenerated sIA wall that is prone to rupture.},
