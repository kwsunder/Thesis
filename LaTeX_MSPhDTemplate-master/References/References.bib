Methods{\textemdash}One hundred nineteen intracranial aneurysms (38 ruptured, 81 unruptured) were analyzed from 3-dimensional angiographic images and computational fluid dynamics. Six morphological and 7 hemodynamic parameters were evaluated for significance with respect to rupture. Receiver operating characteristic analysis identified area under the curve (AUC) and optimal thresholds separating ruptured from unruptured aneurysms for each parameter. Significant parameters were examined by multivariate logistic regression analysis in 3 predictive models{\textemdash}morphology only, hemodynamics only, and combined{\textemdash}to identify independent discriminants, and the AUC receiver operating characteristic of the predicted probability of rupture status was compared among these models. Results{\textemdash}Morphological parameters (size ratio, undulation index, ellipticity index, and nonsphericity index) and hemodynamic parameters (average wall shear stress [WSS], maximum intra-aneurysmal WSS, low WSS area, average oscillatory shear index, number of vortices, and relative resident time) achieved statistical significance (P\&lt;0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated size ratio to be the only independently significant factor in the morphology model (AUC, 0.83; 95\% CI, 0.75 to 0.91), whereas WSS and oscillatory shear index were the only independently significant variables in the hemodynamics model (AUC, 0.85; 95\% CI, 0.78 to 0.93). The combined model retained all 3 variables, size ratio, WSS, and oscillatory shear index (AUC, 0.89; 95\% CI, 0.82 to 0.96). Conclusion{\textemdash}All 3 models{\textemdash}morphological (based on size ratio), hemodynamic (based on WSS and oscillatory shear index), and combined{\textemdash}discriminate intracranial aneurysm rupture status with high AUC values.

	abstract = {Background and Purpose{\textemdash}Follow-up imaging is often performed in intracranial aneurysms that are not treated. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on patient- and aneurysm-specific risk factors for aneurysm growth.Methods{\textemdash}We searched EMBASE and MEDLINE for cohort studies describing risk factors for aneurysm growth. Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and rated quality with the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. With univariable Poisson regression analysis, we calculated risk ratios (RRs) with corresponding 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI) of risk factors for aneurysm growth. Heterogeneity was assessed with I2.Results{\textemdash}Eighteen studies on 15 patient-populations described 3990 patients with 4972 unruptured aneurysms. A total of 437 aneurysms (9\%) enlarged during 13 987 aneurysm-years of follow-up. Compared with aneurysms <=4 mm, RRs were 2.56 (95\% CI, 1.93{\textendash}3.39; I2=98\%) for >=5 mm, 2.80 (95\% CI, 2.01{\textendash}3.90; I2=96\%) for >=7 mm, and 5.38 (95\% CI, 3.76{\textendash}7.70; I2=97\%) for >=10 mm. Compared with aneurysms on the middle cerebral artery, the RR for basilar artery was 1.94 (95\% CI, 1.32{\textendash}2.83; I2=57\%). RRs were 2.03 (95\% CI, 1.52{\textendash}2.71; I2=59\%) for smoking at baseline, 2.04 (95\% CI, 1.56{\textendash}2.66; I2=90\%) for multiple unruptured aneurysms, 1.26 (95\% CI, 0.97{\textendash}1.62; I2=59\%) for women, 1.24 (95\% CI, 0.98{\textendash}1.58; I2=40\%) for hypertension, and 2.32 (95\% CI, 1.46{\textendash}3.68; I2=91\%) for irregular aneurysm shape. Compared with other regions, RR was 0.75 (95\% CI, 0.58{\textendash}0.96) for Japan and 0.64 (95\% CI, 0.45{\textendash}0.90) for Finland.Conclusions{\textemdash}Most risk factors for aneurysm growth are consistent with risk factors for rupture.

We performed an updated systematic review and meta-analysis on the surgical treatment of UIAs, in an attempt to determine the aneurysm occlusion rates and safety of surgery in the modern era. Methods A detailed protocol was developed prior to conducting the review according to the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. Electronic databases spanning January 1990{\textendash}April 2011 were searched, complemented by hand searching. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2, and publication bias with funnel plots. Surgical mortality and morbidity were analysed with weighted random effect models. Results 60 studies with 9845 patients harbouring 10 845 aneurysms were included. Mortality occurred in 157 patients (1.7\%; 99\% CI 0.9\% to 3.0\%; I2=82\%). Unfavourable outcomes, including death, occurred in 692 patients (6.7\%; 99\% CI 4.9\% to 9.0\%; I2=85\%). Morbidity rates were significantly greater in higher quality studies, and with large or posterior circulation aneurysms. Reported morbidity rates decreased over time. Studies were generally of poor quality; funnel plots showed heterogeneous results and publication bias, and data on aneurysm occlusion rates were scant. Conclusions In studies published between 1990 and 2011, clipping of UIAs was associated with 1.7\% mortality and 6.7\% overall morbidity. The reputed durability of clipping has not been rigorously documented. Due to the quality of the included studies, the available literature cannot properly guide clinical decisions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Saccular intracranial aneurysm is a common disease that may cause devastating intracranial hemorrhage. Hemodynamics, wall remodeling, and wall inflammation have been associated with saccular intracranial aneurysm rupture. We investigated how saccular intracranial aneurysm hemodynamics is associated with wall remodeling and inflammation of the saccular intracranial aneurysm wall.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tissue samples resected during a saccular intracranial aneurysm operation (11 unruptured, 9 ruptured) were studied with histology and immunohistochemistry. Patient-specific computational models of hemodynamics were created from preoperative CT angiographies.RESULTS: More stable and less complex flows were associated with thick, hyperplastic saccular intracranial aneurysm walls, while slower flows with more diffuse inflow were associated with degenerated and decellularized saccular intracranial aneurysm walls. Wall degeneration (P = .041) and rupture were associated with increased inflammation (CD45+, P = .031). High wall shear stress (P = .018), higher vorticity (P = .046), higher viscous dissipation (P = .046), and high shear rate (P = .046) were associated with increased inflammation. Inflammation was also associated with lack of an intact endothelium (P = .034) and the presence of organized luminal thrombosis (P = .018), though overall organized thrombosis was associated with low minimum wall shear stress (P = .034) and not with the flow conditions associated with inflammation.CONCLUSIONS: Flow conditions in the saccular intracranial aneurysm are associated with wall remodeling. Inflammation, which is associated with degenerative wall remodeling and rupture, is related to high flow activity, including elevated wall shear stress. Endothelial injury may be a mechanism by which flow induces inflammation in the saccular intracranial aneurysm wall. Hemodynamic simulations might prove useful in identifying saccular intracranial aneurysms at risk of developing inflammation, a potential biomarker for rupture.maxmaximumOSIoscillatory shear indexsIAsaccular intracranial aneurysmVOvorticityWSSwall shear stress},

abstract="Helical flow in the human aorta is possibly a typical example of `form follows function' in the vascular system. The helical blood flow may provide guaranties for the inner surface of the ascending aortic wall to get smooth and even washing by the blood so that atherosclerotic plaques can hardly form in the area of the ascending aorta. It has been documented that the phenomenon of helical flow of blood is not just localized in the ascending aorta, it also exists in several large arteries and veins as well. Preliminary studies demonstrated the widely existing helical flow might play positive physiological roles in facilitating blood flow transport, suppressing disturbed blood flow, preventing the accumulation of atherogenic low density lipoproteins on the luminal surfaces of arteries, enhancing oxygen transport from the blood to the arterial wall and reducing the adhesion of blood cells on the arterial surface. These roles of helical blood flow may lessen the burden of arteries and protect the arteries from the pathology of atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and intimal hyperplasia. The great development of time-resolved three-dimensional phase contrast MRI (flow-sensitive 4D-MRI) and the advent of dimensionless indices such as helical flow index proposed to characterize helical flow make clinic quantification of the helical flow in the human large arteries possible. Moreover, researchers probed into the possibility to apply the mechanism of helical flow to the design of vascular interventions to reduce thrombus formation and intimal hyperplasia caused by abnormal flow conditions.",

abstract={Saccular intracranial aneurysms (sIA) are pouch-like pathological dilatations of intracranial arteries that develop when the cerebral artery wall becomes too weak to resist hemodynamic pressure and distends. Some sIAs remain stable over time, but in others mural cells die, the matrix degenerates, and eventually the wall ruptures, causing life-threatening hemorrhage. The wall of unruptured sIAs is characterized by myointimal hyperplasia and organizing thrombus, whereas that of ruptured sIAs is characterized by a decellularized, degenerated matrix and a poorly organized luminal thrombus. Cell-mediated and humoral inflammatory reaction is seen in both, but inflammation is clearly associated with degenerated and ruptured walls. Inflammation, however, seems to be a reaction to the ongoing degenerative processes, rather than the cause. Current data suggest that the loss of mural cells and wall degeneration are related to impaired endothelial function and high oxidative stress, caused in part by luminal thrombosis. The aberrant flow conditions caused by sIA geometry are the likely cause of the endothelial dysfunction, which results in accumulation of cytotoxic and pro-inflammatory substances into the sIA wall, as well as thrombus formation. This may start the processes that eventually can lead to the decellularized and degenerated sIA wall that is prone to rupture.},
