I would like to thank all the members of my committee and my advisor Dr. Jingfeng Jiang. Their leadership, support, knowledge and motivation not only helped me throughout my research, but helped drive me to become a better scientist and to never stop learning.

Special thanks are also needed for Dr. Autumn Schumacher, who was willing to take a gamble on a brand new scientist fresh out of their undergraduate education. Her  and expertise (and many hours of manuscript editing) were invaluable in getting me to where I am today.

I would also like to thank my friends for their boundless confidence in me which helped push me through my PhD work. Last but not the least, I would of course like to thank my family. All of their love and support helped make this thesis possible.
