\chapter{Introduction}\label{CHAPTER1}

Subarachnoid hemorrhage is a potentially devastating pathologic condition in which bleeding between the brain and the tissues that cover the brain. One of the prevalent pathologic conditions that may result in subarachnoid hemorrhage is the rupture of an intracranial aneurysm (IA)

Research has shown that there may be a wide array of risk factors that impact IA rupture \cite{Korja1958}.

\subsection{Objective}\label{CHAPTER1_SECTION1_SUBSECTION1}

Although there exists a number of studies\cite{can2015association,zhou2017association,varble2018stroke} and methodologies\cite{etminan2015unruptured,greving2014development} that attempt to assess IAs at a high risk of rupture, inconsistencies between study outcomes leave the development of an ideal predictive model out of reach. In addition, many of these previous studies assess the geometric\cite{abboud2017morphology,kashiwazaki2013size,varble2018stroke} and/or hemodynamic wall stressors\cite{zhou2017association,Miura519,can2015association} as a means to predict IA rupture, with limited quantitative assessment of the hemodynamic flow conditions within the aneurysm. \textbf{The primary objective} of this work is to assess the viability of adapting quantitative analysis of hemodynamic flow patterns, specifically swirling flow pattern(s) (vortex), within IAs to improve the prediction and understanding of IA rupture. In this work, an overview of recent theories concerning

\subsection{Methodolgy}\label{CHAPTER1_SECTION1_SUBSECTION2}
For the initial focus of this work, image-based computational fluid dynamics models of patient-specific IA geometry will be constructed from 3D phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI). Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations will be performed on the computational models to generate realistic 3D hemodyanmic velocity and flow pattern data. From said data,

\section{Aneurysm Geometic Characterisitcs}\label{CHAPTER1_SECTION2}

All aneurysm geometries were taken from the finalized computational mesh generated for simulations. The aneurysm sac was manually isolated from the parent vessel and the resultant cut plane was capped and identified as the IA ostium using an in-house script written in VMTK. Geometric measurements were either taken directly from the values reported in the Aneurisk dataset, or were calculated using in-house scripts in VMTK. 

\underline{Aneurysm Surface Area and Volume}: Measured directly from the isolated IA geometry before and after (respectively) ostium capping. A number of studies have eluded to an increase in IA size as a risk for both IA growth and rupture. \cite{varble2018stroke,brinjikji2015risk,Backes951,greving2014development}. A meta-analysis performed by Brinjikji et al reported that IA $\le$ 10 mm in size (diameter) grew at a rate $<$ 2.9\% per year, while IAs $>$ 10 mm were associated with growth rates of 9.7\% per year. This growth was also reported with an associated IA rupture rate: 3.1\% per year compared with 0.1\% per year for stable (non-growing) aneurysms (p $\le$ 01). From a clinical perspective, the overall size of an aneurysm is often a characteristic used to determine course of IA treatment (or lack thereof) \cite{williams2013management,komotar2008guidelines}. Yet while large IAs are thought to increase the likelihood of rupture, a not-insignificant number of small IAs ($<$5 mm diameter) also have been shown to rupture \cite{kashiwazaki2013size,forget2001review,Korja2014}. This disparity between sizes of ruptured IAs suggest that the assessment of additional factors in tandem with IA size improve rupture prediction. 

\underline{Aneurysm Height}: The length of the centerline of the IA sac is measured, following the IA shape, as opposed to measuring a straight line from the ostium centroid directly to the highest IA point. The radius of the maximum inscribed sphere at the centerline's furthest point is added to the length measurement to fully measure the IA height. This is a modified version of the typical IA height measurement: a straight line of the maximum stretch from the ostium centroid to the IA dome \cite{ma2010size,duan2018morphological}. 

\underline{Vessel Diameter}: The parent artery diameter value is computed at locations close to the aneurysm ostium. For side-wall aneurysms only the location prior to the aneurysm is used. For terminal aneurysms, the vessel diameter along the common branch and both daughter arteries are measured and averaged.

\underline{Inlet Cross-sectional Area}: The beginning of the inlet vessel was cut square in the 3-matic software package, the resultant cross-sectional area of the inlet vessel was calculated. 
 
\underline{Aspect Ratio*}: A modified calculation of the commonly defined aspect ratio (aneurysm hight/ostium diameter) was used adapting the sac centerline (SC) length as a measure of aneurysm height \cite{piccinelli2012characterization}.
\begin{equation}
Aspect Ratio* = (SC_{length} / (4*(Ostium_{area} / Ostium_{circumfrence})))
\end{equation}

\section{Aneurysm Hemodynamic Characterisitcs}\label{CHAPTER1_SECTION3}


\underline{Wall Shear Stress}: 
The calculation of wall shear stress (WSS) is performed by the ANSYS-FLUENT commercial finite-element solver (ANSYS v17.0). The value is defined as the normal velocity gradient against the (vessel) wall:
\begin{equation} \label{WSS}
\tau_w = \mu\frac{\partial v}{\partial n}
\end{equation}
with $\mu$ as the fluid dynamic viscosity (0.004 kg/m-s). 

The spatial-temporally averaged value of the aneurysm's WSS was calculated alongside its temporally-averaged WSS minimum and temporally-averaged WSS maximum. 

\underline{Kinetic Energy Density}:

\section{Disturbed Flow on Vascular Endothelium}\label{Chapter1_Section4}

The vascular endothelial cell (EC) layer forms the innermost lining of blood vessels, directly interacting with hemodynamic stressors and helping to maintain homeostatic functions of the vasculature\cite{chien2007mechanotransduction,gimbrone2016endothelial}. The mechanotransduction capabilities of this initial vascular layer help maintain a selective macromoleuclar barrier, trigger vascular remodeling, regulate vascular smooth muscle cell contraction\cite{vanhoutte2009endothelial}, and help control vascular inflammatory responses\cite{chalouhi2012biology}. The degradation of vascular homeostatsis, resultant from disturbed hemodynamic flow patterns, has been associated with an array of vascular pathologies: aneurysms\cite{Cebral119,LONGO2017632}, atherosclerosis\cite{Liu2015}, and thrombosis\cite{chiu2011effects,uzarski2013adaptation}. Due to the life threating nature of IAs, improved quantitative methods to characterize hemodynamic patterns and to what degree they impart EC pathologic changes, could prove essential to further our understanding of the disease's initiation and progression. 

The morphology and cytoskeletoal organization of EC have been shown to be susceptible to non-laminar flow conditions\cite{wang2013endothelial}. Typically, EC morphology aligns along flow directionality, forming organized parallel actin stress fibers and giving the cells an elongated  
structure\cite{thomas2016biomimetic,gimbrone2016endothelial,balaguru2016disturbed}. Disrupted flow patterns resulting in vortex flow and altered WSS, show a differential change in EC characteristics: a rounded morphology with marginally located short actin stress fibers\cite{chiu2011effects,uzarski2013adaptation,dolan2011high}.


The inflammatory process within vasculature has been shown to be a significant actor in the pathogenesis of IA development and potential rupture \cite{chalouhi2012biology,hashimoto2006,signorelli2018}. In a typical physiological setting, the vascular EC layer maintains antiatherogenic characteristics, inhibiting platelet adhesion and aggregation along the vascular wall, as well as limiting cellular pro-inflammatory pathways\cite{ALSOUDI2017951}. In the occurrence of IA pathology, a breakdown of the EC inflammatory-limiting capabilities is noted: small aneurysm shown to have intimal thickening and diffuse macrophage/lymphocyte infiltration, whereas chronic atherosclerotic lesions with embedded macrophages and lymphocytes have been noted in larger aneurysms\cite{Frösen2012,kosierkiewicz1994}. Upon leukocyte and macrophage infiltration, the matrix metalloproteinase enzyme is released which digests extracellular matrix proteins leading to additional pathologic damage to the vascular wall\cite{tronic2000,aoki2007a}. The remodeling of the vascular wall, impart due to inflammatory pathogenic activities, lead to an overall loss vessel mechanical strength and a possible ballooning out of the impacted area
